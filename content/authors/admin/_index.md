Hi! My name is Rozum Sergey, and this is my portfolio. 

I am a ux-researcher with wide experience in different types of research. I have worked on marketing, political, and user experience studies.

I love coming up with new methodological cadavers for more efficient research. Also, I'm obsessed with data visualization and know what data/ink ratio is.
