I often come across the need to count certain indexes in my work. For some of the indexes, you can find calculators (excel files where you can enter the source data and quickly get the desired index). For some of them, there are not.

And it is hard to keep everything under control. You have to dig through your files every time, remember in which excel you made calculations, remember where you left the right calculator last time.

To put this matter in order a little and make life easier for those colleagues who do not want to re-enter the necessary formulas into Excel every time, I decided to collect calculators for those indexes that I often calculate in one excel file.

I present to your attention the [Swiss Army Research Excelbook](/Swiss_Excelbook_V0.1b.xlsx). It contains methods for calculating most common indexes. Ideally, it should be as versatile as a Swiss army knife, so in the future I will supplement the methods and refine available calculators. In the meantime, meet beta.

#### How does it work?

- Download file
- Select the appropriate tab
- Insert the cleaned raw data there

The file itself has detailed instructions on what you can and can't touch, how the raw data should look like, and some tips on using the indexes themselves

What calculators are already available

* **UMUX** - for calculating the Usability Metric for User Experience and SUS (Single Usability Score)

* **NPS** - for calculating the Net Promoter Score

* **SUM** - for calculating the Single Usability Metric based on the results of the usability test

* **Kano** -  to analyze the results of the survey using the Kano model
 
* **CSI** - for calculating the Customer Satisfaction Index

* **PSM** - to assess the price sensitivity according to van Westendorp
