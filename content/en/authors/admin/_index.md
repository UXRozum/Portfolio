I'm Rozum Sergey, an UX researcher passionate about understanding people and their experiences. 

In my journey, I've explored diverse research fields, including marketing, politics, and user experience. I enjoy crafting creative research approaches that make our work more effective. I'm also a bit of a data visualization enthusiastâ€”I love turning data into meaningful stories.

Thanks for stopping by and getting to know a bit about me. Feel free to explore my work and reach out if you have any questions.
