 ## Project 
 One of the teams wanted to add new features in the internal assistant app for HR-specialists. But, at first, they needed to understand our hiring process from an HR point of view. They asked us to study the hiring process and find possible points of improvement.
 
 ## Objective 
 
 Our objective was to draw a process diagram for hiring activities in our company. And find some problematic sections there. 

 ## My work
 Our team consisted of me and one other researcher. My responsibilities were to make a research design, write a scenario for interviews and pilot it. I chose in-depths problematic interviews as our main instrument. But, the pilot interview showed, that it's hard for respondents to talk about the whole process. So we decided to draw a process scheme for respondents.
 
 ## Result

 That was a huge success. Respondents started to speak more lively. Some of them even noticed errors and inaccuracies in our scheme and started to draw their variants. 
In-depth interviews gained some co-creative flavor, the physical scheme made the abstract interview easier for respondents. Also, the wrong parts of the scheme engaged respondents to give us more information about the process.

 ## Reflection

 After this project, I used this trick several times. And it works every time. People need to correct other people's mistakes works as a great ice-breaker. And visual stuff helps analyze the abstract process.
