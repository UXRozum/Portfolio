For some of the indexes, you can find calculators (excel files where you can enter the source data and quickly get the desired index). For some of them, there are not.\nAnd it is hard to keep everything under control. You have to dig through your files every time, remember in which excel you made calculations, remember where you left the right calculator last time.\nTo put this matter in order a little and make life easier for those colleagues who do not want to re-enter the necessary formulas into Excel every time, I decided to collect calculators for those indexes that I often calculate in one excel file.\nI present to your attention the Swiss Army Research Excelbook. It contains methods for calculating most common indexes.

Both types of landing pages contain the same services at the same prices. Even so, partner\u0026rsquo;s landing pages had two times more conversion rates than the company\u0026rsquo;s landings. And it was necessary to find the reason for this difference. As a lead ux-researcher, I was doing this project solo.\nMy work I had two major assumptions:\n  It is a behavioral difference - people, who see compare several providers using third party partner\u0026rsquo;s pages, are more likely to make target action. They already saw all offers.\n  It\u0026rsquo;s usability issues - it\u0026rsquo;s harder to make target action on company landing pages.\n  The second assumption was more effortless to test, so I\u0026rsquo;ve settled up with comparative unmoderated remote usability tests in several regions. I made six groups of respondents - two regions and three types of pages. The scenario was mostly identical, except for test data. The target action was to send a request for service. And the process of sending a request contains validation of the customer\u0026rsquo;s home address. For one region, I found the simple address ( i.e., Lenin Street, 25). For the second region, the test address was more complicated (i.e., Zhukov Boulevard, 36).\nThe process was quite normal - using Usability Factory software, I made several tasks for each group, sent them to respondents, got data, and started the analysis.\nResult The difference in metrics was quite drastic. But it wasn\u0026rsquo;t the difference between partner\u0026rsquo;s and company\u0026rsquo;s landings. The company\u0026rsquo;s landing page got remarkably more SUM score difference between two types of test address than partner\u0026rsquo;s. And between SUM metrics, the effectiveness shows the most difference.\nFurther analysis showed that the main reason for this difference was the behavior of the address validation form. And the more complicated address, the more evident was the issue.\nThe form just didn\u0026rsquo;t let a customer use any abbreviations of the word except one right abbreviation. For example, the only correct abbreviation for \u0026ldquo;Boulevard\u0026rdquo; is \u0026ldquo;Bl-vd\u0026rdquo;. It\u0026rsquo;s quite an uncommon abbreviation. It wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be a critical issue, but weird behavior continues. The user doesn\u0026rsquo;t see a \u0026ldquo;Wrong address\u0026rdquo; type of error. The system shows the \u0026ldquo;You can\u0026rsquo;t get service at this address\u0026rdquo; error. So, it is not only easy to make a mistake. Also, you don\u0026rsquo;t know that there is a mistake.\nBut, this behavior is identical for both company\u0026rsquo;s and partners' landing pages. It couldn\u0026rsquo;t be the causal factor of the difference in SUM. And now I want to talk not only about the mechanical behavior of the system. The main difference lies in one tiny detail, which shows the whole nature of the customer experience. Partners' landing pages allow a user to request a service even with an address, that was wrong from the system\u0026rsquo;s point of view. The company\u0026rsquo;s landing page shows the advertisement of the other service.\nReflection To let people send the form with the wrong address maybe just a lack of QA. And yes, it\u0026rsquo;s more logical and right to make the proper error message or make the more understanding address validator.\nBut even if this small thing is a mistake, it makes the form that is much more usable than the more technically proper form on the company\u0026rsquo;s landing page.\nI love this case not only because it shows my skills in usability analytics. Also because it shows how much some minute trifles in usability could affect the whole product.\n","date":1612915200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1612915200,"objectID":"437abe30062721554bdd982f2f62311d","permalink":"/post/landing-pages/","publishdate":"2021-02-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/landing-pages/","section":"post","summary":"Interesting case for unmoderated usability-test","tags":["Remote usability tests","Usability Analytics","Comparative research design"],"title":"Competitive usability test of three landing pages","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"About project The product owner (PO) had an idea to make the new product for accountants. To get approval from high management, she had to provide the scope of accountants' problems, which this new product could solve. So she asked me to make several interviews with some accountants, to get this scope. She didn\u0026rsquo;t have a team for this product, so I worked as a one-man team.\nThe first and main objective was to understand typical accountant problems. But, there was a problem with time - we had only 1 week to provide the results. The second problem lied in the budget field - we didn\u0026rsquo;t have any money to recruit respondents.\nMy work Usually, you either don\u0026rsquo;t have time to recruit or don\u0026rsquo;t have money to hire a recruitment agency. Lack of both brings up the need for some creative solution. I found the solution by choosing a different way to get the needed information. The objective was just to get the initial information. In this case, you can get by without interviews.\nCrawling some accountant\u0026rsquo;s forums and groups on Facebook, I parsed 400 posts, containing questions or issues. Then I tagged each post and found several dozens of problematic themes.\nI solved the problem, but there happened to be one more obstacle. PO needed to present it as a research result, and management had some mistrust in the desktop research. So we needed to present the research design from the best side.\nAnd here come some naming trick. I wrote about how parsing posts count as a \u0026ldquo;digital-powered non-participant ethnographic observation\u0026rdquo;, or just Digital Ethnography.\nResult The presentation was successful, high-management was glad. PO got approval, some ideas for the product, and resources to make a more thorough research. After that case, our research team adopted this approach.\nReflection On the one hand, it was not a great case for serious research. On the other, I solved the time and money dilemma. The research brought the needed information and got accepted by high-management. The second option for this project was to make several expert interviews with accountants in our company. But it was riskier - I could screw up and waste all my time in search of respondents. So I still think it was the best way to get results fast.\n","date":1612742400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1612742400,"objectID":"adce4de8382a630a6b80c57e4a0c5ea2","permalink":"/post/digital-ethnography/","publishdate":"2021-02-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/digital-ethnography/","section":"post","summary":"Desktop research sold right","tags":["Generative research","Observation methods","Ethnography"],"title":"Digital ethnography, or naming miracle","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"It looks like another Goldberg machine. But, in reality, this technique could serve as an additional source of truth. You can’t have too many factors when you have to decide which usability problems correct foremost. And also, most of the techniques to prioritize usability problems are subjective, it’s good to add some more objectivity there.\nWhat is QCA? As a method, QCA was made to work in cases, where the general population is too small to use quantitative methods. For example, where you want to determine which factors lead to the economic prosperity of a state. There are nearly 200 states on our planet, so it’s hard to find enough cases for a quantitative study. And here comes Qualitative Comparative Analysis on fancy Boolean algebra horse. This method helps us to estimate the causal strength of each factor. With this, we can say, which usability problem is most crucial to fix.\n(This method matches better for remote unmoderated studies, where you can analyze more respondents. Not 5-10, but 10-20. And this is not a replacement for other methods to estimate critically for usability problems. It’s better to use them all).\nBasic concepts of QCA The base of this method is a deep understanding of cause-effect relations. In our case “Cause” is a usability problem and “Effect” is a success (or failure) of task completion. So, for every effect, there is a cause, and to describe the power of this relation we will use two measures — Necessity and Sufficiency.\nNecessity Necessity is the measure that shows how necessary cause for an effect.\nIn this picture we see the case of 100% necessity – there is no effect without this cause.\nSufficiency Sufficiency shows us, at which extent causes enough to cause the effect.\nIn this picture we see 100% sufficiency – there is no cause without the effect.\nAnd so, 100% sufficiency and 100% necessity will give us 100% correlation:\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not 100% in this pic, just for you to understand the mechanism.\nPlaying with these two metrics we can make a synthetic index which we could use as a measure of the criticality of a usability problem:\nCR =(NS+SF)/2\nSo, with 100% sufficiency and 100% necessity, we will have 100% critically.\nTo calculate these metrics we use truth tables (where each problem called \u0026ldquo;Factor\u0026rdquo;, as a possible cause). And for each factor we do separate tables: Where:\n  A is the number of cases, where factor and effect are both presents\n  B is the number of cases, where factor is absent and effect is present\n  C is the number of cases, where factor is present and effect is absent\n  D is the number of cases where factor and effect are both absent\n  So, Necessity (Nc) measure will be:\n NS = A(A+B)  And, Sufficiency (Sf)\n SF = A/(A+C)  And, finally, our Criticality Index will be:\n CI = (Nc+Sf)/2  Let’s watch these ideas on semi-real example! We have this one usability test protocol:\nNote, factors here are problems, and the effect is the failure (failed task)\nTo test the Necessity and Sufficiency of each problem, we should count each A/B/C/D case: And after this we could easily calculate all metrics using our formulas: As we see, Problem 3 got the highest critical score, which means that correcting this problem will get us the highest benefit.\nConclusion And with this, we got on our hands another criticality evaluation method, which could help us to improve our backlog prioritization. We just barely touched the surface of QCA, so this field is untilled. And I would be really glad if anyone wants to dig deeper, there are tons of methodological treasures looking for their discoverer!\n","date":1612742400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1612742400,"objectID":"112fe117b35a38f1804e8f4d772efa02","permalink":"/project/qca-for-usability-tests/","publishdate":"2021-02-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/qca-for-usability-tests/","section":"project","summary":"Using Qualitative Comparative Analysis for usability problems prioritization.","tags":["Qualitative Comparative Analysis","Usability Analytics"],"title":"QCA for usability tests","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Project One of the teams wanted to add new features in the internal assistant app for HR-specialists. But, at first, they needed to understand our hiring process from an HR point of view. They asked us to study the hiring process and find possible points of improvement.\nObjective Our objective was to draw a process diagram for hiring activities in our company. And find some problematic sections there.\nMy work Our team consisted of me and one other researcher. My responsibilities were to make a research design, write a scenario for interviews and pilot it. I chose in-depths problematic interviews as our main instrument. But, the pilot interview showed, that it\u0026rsquo;s hard for respondents to talk about the whole process. So we decided to draw a process scheme for respondents.\nResult That was a huge success. Respondents started to speak more lively. Some of them even noticed errors and inaccuracies in our scheme and started to draw their variants. In-depth interviews gained some co-creative flavor, the physical scheme made the abstract interview easier for respondents. Also, the wrong parts of the scheme engaged respondents to give us more information about the process.\nReflection After this project, I used this trick several times. And it works every time.
